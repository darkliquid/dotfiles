Config files to make my life easier

Sets up a number of scripts and installs some bare minimums to make life nicer. Designed to work primarily for a WSL-environment but still fallback nicely to pure Linux.

## Assumptions

 * WSL environment is Ubuntu 20.04
 * WSL username is the same name as your Windows username
